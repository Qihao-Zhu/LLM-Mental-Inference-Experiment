0,2,Luggage,"The luggage is small in size to fit as a cabbin baggage while being big enough to fit all the materials.

4,3,laptop,"The laptop is very sleek and had a long battery life at first. The battery life is a little shorter now but still very good. Biggest concern is that the RAM often gets fully used up and apps must be closed to free up memory, but otherwise the laptop is very fast and functions well. Very easy to use.",post,I aim to use the laptop's apps and browser for long periods of time in the day.

5,1,Sponge,"The sponge is functional enough when washing, although its rough side is not rough enough to deal with tough stains or stuck pieces of food, and I end up having to use steel wool. It was very cheap, but also doesn't feel very durable. The dishes are cleaned well, although it is annoying afterwards to have to squeeze out the suds to let it dry so the sponge itself stays clean.",post,"The goal is to ensure dishes are clean of food and germs, as well as to ensure the sponge can be kept clean for future use.","I should be able to apply water (warm) and dish soap to the sponge, and then by scrubbing the dishes, it will be cleaned.

6,2,Portable charger,"I like this charger, it has a long battery life and it is small so that it does not take up too much space in my backpack. The only problem is that it leaks battery so if it not in use for a while, it runs out of charge even though I have not used it.",post,I aim to charge my phone on the go.

7,3,Razer Naga Trinity Mouse,"The Trinity is a great replacement and upgrade from the previous mouse I had. As someone who frequently plays World of Warcraft (which requires the use of multiple different keys) with long nails, the 12-button side panel has made my experience a lot better! It is also useful for making keyboard shortcuts for office use as well. 
 
 Programming the mouse was easy through the downloadable Razer software, although a different app (SteerMouse) was required to reprogram it on my Macbook. I also found it difficult to save the keybinds to the onboard memory, and found myself reprogramming it on each new device I plugged it into. RGB lighting is also a plus, and can be controlled thru the Razer software as well. 
 
 If you are intimidated by the 12-button side design, I would recommend to go for it as there are three different side panels included which are easily swappable (they attach with magnets) and you can use 2 of 7 button panels instead.",post,"I aim to improve my gameplay efficiency in WoW.

8,1,Swiffer wet mop,"The wet mop is useful in cleaning up some basic dirt and whatnot, but really seems to struggle when it comes to more ingrained floor stains.

It is compatible with a USB-A charging chord, it doesn't come with a chord, but the one you use for your phone should work.

17,2,luggage,"I chose this carryon luggage because it is a larger size, and has a good internal organization. It includes several pockets, including a padded compartment for a laptop. I bought it from a discount store, thus the price was reasonable. Unlike other popular options, it does not have a hard outer shell, however, I did not feel I need this feature, as my last luggage did not have a hard shell, and lasted for 15+ years.",post,"1) I am to pack necessary items for travel in a variety of scenarios.

20,2,Carry-on suitcase,"I recently bought this hard-shell carry-on suitcase for a three-week trip to various countries. I am generally happy with the functionality of the suitcase, as the suitcase itself is very light, has multiple compartments, and has an expandable zipper when packing lots of items. The size is also perfect because it abides by the different carry-on limits set by individual airlines or countries. I only have two complaints about the suitcase: first, the built-in lock is not TSA approved, so I have to use an external padlock, at least when traveling in the United States. Second, the wheels on the suitcase are made of thin plastic, which is not ideal for traveling in places where walking long distances on sidewalks is necessary. Even after a few weeks of use, there was considerable wear and scratches on the wheels.",post,"I aim to carry my belongings easily when traveling.
